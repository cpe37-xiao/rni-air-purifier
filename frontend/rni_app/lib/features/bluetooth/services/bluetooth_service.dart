/// [BlueService] (Not to be confused with `BluetoothService` from `flutter_blue_plus` package)
///
/// A [singleton] (only one instance) service responsible for handling Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
/// communication logic using the `flutter_blue_plus` package. Works closely with [BluetoothProvider],
/// which consumes this service to expose reactive state to the UI.
///
/// This service is responsible for:
/// - Scanning for nearby BLE devices
/// - Connecting and disconnecting from a BLE device
/// - Discovering BLE services and characteristics
/// - Subscribing to incoming notifications from the ESP32 (TX)
/// - Writing outgoing data to the ESP32 (RX)
///
/// ## Singleton Pattern
/// [BlueService] is implemented as a singleton to ensure only one instance
/// manages the BLE adapter and characteristics at any time.
///
/// ```dart
/// final service = BlueService(); // Always returns the same instance
/// ```
///
/// ## BLE Communication Model
/// ```
/// Flutter (RX Write) ──► ESP32 RX Characteristic (6E400002)
/// Flutter (TX Notify) ◄── ESP32 TX Characteristic (6E400003)
///                         └── Both under Nordic UART Service (6E400001)
/// ```
